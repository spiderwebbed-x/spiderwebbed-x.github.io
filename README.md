# The Bones of a Story

Set construction is a long process.

The first step is to lay down the story's skeleton.

Put the organs in place.

Understand its components, its moving parts.

When you set it in motion, you need a firm grasp of such things, in order
to follow its path towards its destination.

I see that you have come here.

This is a personal ideabook repository. You found it, and so you can
examine the bones and organs of my stories before they have been given
life. That should be prize enough; no license to reproduce or modify is
conferred.

When the story is all written, all told... that may change.
